`extractox` is a comprehensive R package designed to simplify querying various chemical, toxicological, and biological databases such as the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTP) of the  MDI Biological Laboratory and NC State University, the Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE) of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard Resource Hub (CompTox) of EPA, and PubChem of the National Center for Biotechnology Information/National Institures Of Health (NCBI, NIH). The package facilitates interaction with APIs, providing curated and user-friendly outputs.

To communicate with Pubchem, `extractox` relies on the package`webchem`.

## Installation

Install the package `extractox` from CRAN.

```r
# From CRAN
install.packages("extractox")
```
### Development Version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of `extractox` from GitHub.

```r
# Install pak if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}

# Install the package from GitHub
pak::pkg_install("c1au6i0/extractox")
```

## Features

###  ICE Database

The ICE database, managed by the EPA, provides access to a variety of data related to chemical toxicity, exposure, and risk assessment. It includes data from high-throughput screening assays, in vivo studies, and computational models.

`extr_ice` provides access to NTP’s ICE database for toxicological and exposure-related data.


```{r}
library(extractox)
ice_data <- extr_ice(casrn = c("50-00-0"), assays = NULL) # assays is null so all assays are retrieved
names(ice_data)
```

There are more than **2000 possible assays** in ICE. The `extr_ice_assay_names()` function allows to search for assay names that match a pattern you're interested in. Please note that searches are case sensitive and accept regexp.

```{r}
extr_ice_assay_names("Rat Acute") # keep empty to retrieve all
```


### IRIS

The IRIS database is managed by the EPA and contains information on the health effects of exposure to various substances found in the environment. It provides qualitative and quantitative health risk information.

`extr_iris` provides access to EPA’s IRIS database and accepts queries CASRN or IUPAC names of chemicals.

```{r}
iris_info <- extr_iris(c("glyphosate", "50-00-0"))
names(iris_info)
```


### CompTox

The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard, managed by the EPA, provides access to data on chemical structures, properties, and associated bioactivity data. It integrates data from various sources to support chemical safety assessments.

`extr_comptox` extracts data from the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard using both CASRN and IUPAC names of chemicals and returns a list of **dataframes**.

```{r}
info_comptox <- extr_comptox(ids = c("Aspirin", "50-00-0"))
names(info_comptox)
```


### WHO IARC

The IARC Monographs database is managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and contains evaluations of the carcinogenic risks of various substances to humans. It provides detailed information about Monographs, including publication volumes and years, evaluation years, and additional relevant details.

The functione `extr_monograph` provides access to the WHO IARC Monographs database and accepts queries using CASRN or the names of chemicals.


```{r}
dat <- extr_monograph(search_type = "casrn", ids = c("105-74-8", "120-58-1"))
str(dat)

# Example usage for name search
dat2 <- extr_monograph(search_type = "name", ids = c("Aloe", "Schistosoma", "Styrene"))
```


### Tox Info

The function `extr_tox` is a wrapper used to call all the above-mentioned functions and retrieve a list of dataframes.

```{r}
info_tox <- extr_tox(casrn = c("Aspirin", "50-00-0"))
```

### CTD Database

The CTP provides information about the interactions between chemicals, genes, and diseases. It helps in understanding the effects of environmental exposures on human health.

A series of functions interact with the CTP database.

`extr_ctd` extracts information related to chemical-gene or pathway associations.

```{r}
input_terms <- c("50-00-0", "64-17-5", "methanal", "ethanol")
ctd_association <- extr_ctd(
  input_terms = input_terms,
  category = "chem",
  report_type = "genes_curated",
  input_term_search_type = "directAssociations",
  action_types = "ANY",
  ontology = c("go_bp", "go_cc")
)


# Get expresssion data
ctd_expression <- extr_ctd(
  input_terms = input_terms,
  report_type = "cgixns",
  category = "chem",
  action_types = "expression"
)

names(ctd_expression)
```


Tetramers are computationally generated information units that interrelate four data types from the CTP: a chemical, gene product, phenotype, and disease. They help in understanding the complex relationships between these entities and their combined impact on human health.

`extr_tetramer` extract info related to tetramers from CTD.

```{r}
tetramer_data <- extr_tetramer(
  chem = c("50-00-0", "ethanol"),
  disease = "",
  gene = "",
  go = "",
  input_term_search_type = "directAssociations",
  qt_match_type = "equals"
)

names(tetramer_data)
```

###  PubChem Database

PubChem is an open chemistry database at the NIH. It provides information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and physical properties, biological activities, safety and toxicity information, patents, literature citations, and more.

A series of functions that rely on the `webchem` package are used to extract chemical information, Globally Harmonized System (`GHS`) classification data, or flavor classification from PubChem.

The function `extr_chem_info` retrieves chemical information of IUPAC-named chemicals. A warning is displayed if the chemical is not found.

```{r}
chem_info <- extr_chem_info(IUPAC_names = c("Formaldehyde", "Aflatoxin B1"))
names(chem_info)
```


Two functions are used to extract specific sections of PubChem chemical information using CASRN:

- `extr_pubchem_ghs` extracts Globally Harmonized System (GHS) codes.
- `extr_pubchem_fema` extracts flavor profile data.


```{r}
ghs_info <- extr_pubchem_ghs(casrn = c("50-00-0", "64-17-5"))
fema_info <- extr_pubchem_fema(casrn = c("50-00-0", "123-68-2"))
```


## Important Note for Linux Users

Please note that functions that pull data from EPA servers may encounter issues on some Linux systems. This is because these servers do not accept secure legacy renegotiation. On Linux system, those functions depend on `curl` and `OpenSSL`, which have known problems with unsafe legacy renegotiation in newer versions. One workaround is to downgrade to `curl v7.78.0` and `OpenSSL v1.1.1`. However, please be aware that using these older versions might introduce potential security vulnerabilities.
Refer to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/c1au6i0/5cc2d87966340a31032ffebf1cfb657c) for instructions on how to downgrade `curl` and `OpenSSL` on Ubuntu.
